 function name: [Reg,V] = Var_Alignment(inputImage,method,iter_ref,Fs)

 description:
 the function corrects the latency shift of evoked potentials by choosing a stable
 reference and realigning the 2D Sweep Image of the data. It performs 1 dimensional alignment according to the selected reference.
 method: cross correlation, mean of all image rows 
 default: 'Mean'


 ## input: 

 type :        input Image (take the Sweep matrix, Single trial matrix as input Image)
 method :      'Cross', 'Mean'                      
 iter_ref :    iterative refinement
 Fs :          Sampling Frequency of the signal

 ## output

 Reg =         the realigned image after image registration
   V =         the displacement field of all pixels/samples
