# Toolbox for nonlinear, anisotropic diffusion on the GPU

Fast and fully vectorized MATLAB implementation of non-linear, anisotropic diffusion with gpuarray and RGB image support. Implemented diffusion types are edge enhancing and coherence enhancing diffusion (Weickert, 1999) as well as Perona-Malik non-linear isotropic diffusion with different diffusivities.
