## Anisotropic diffusion
If you use nonlinear, anisotropic diffusion for your work, please refer to this [repository](https://github.com/phflot/diffusion_toolbox.git).
Implemented diffusion types are edge enhancing and coherence enhancing diffusion (Weickert, 1999) as well as Perona-Malik non-linear isotropic diffusion with different diffusivities.
